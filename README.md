Whether you're a developer, system administrator, or casual user, this command interpreter aims to simplify your interaction with the computer by offering a versatile set of commands.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter is a Python-based tool that allows users to execute commands and perform actions directly from the command line. It supports a wide range of commands, including file manipulation, system operations, and custom scripts.

### How to Start

To start the command interpreter, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system (version 3.x recommended).
2. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
   
   git clone https://github.com/Norbert250/AirBnB_clone.git
   
3. Navigate to the project directory.
  
   cd command-interpreter
  
4. Run the command interpreter script.
   
   python interpreter.py
   

### How to Use

Once the command interpreter is running, you can enter commands and execute various operations. The general syntax for a command is:


command_name [arguments]


For a list of available commands and their usage, you can use the `help` command:
