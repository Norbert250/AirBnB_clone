HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create the structure of web pages. It consists of a series of elements enclosed in tags that define different parts of a webpage such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. HTML provides the skeleton or backbone of a webpage by organizing content into a hierarchical structure.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and layout of HTML documents. It enables web developers to define styles such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning for HTML elements. By separating the content (HTML) from its presentation (CSS), developers can create visually appealing and consistent designs across multiple web pages.

When HTML and CSS are combined, they allow web developers to create visually appealing and well-structured web pages. HTML defines the structure and content, while CSS defines the style and layout.
